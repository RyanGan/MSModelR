# MSModelR

Custom functions to run marginal structural models using simple substitution and inverse probability of treatment weighting 

Functions include g.formula and iptw. Both are pretty crude right now, but they work. I may develop further if there is intrest from others. Also, I recommend loading broom package for bootstrapping via percentile if confidence intervals are desired. There is also the bootstrap package, but broom is pretty easy.

Can be installed from this GitHub with the "devtools"" package and the following:

install_github("RyanGan/MSModelR")

### Future Plans

Develop a vignette.

Flush out the functions.
