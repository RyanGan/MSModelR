# MSModelR
Custom functions to run marginal structural models using simple substitution and inverse probability of treatment weighting 

Functions include g.estimation and iptw.estimation. Both are pretty crude right now, but the work. I may develop further if there is intrest from others. Also recommend loading broom package for bootstrapping via percentile if confidence intervals are desired.

Can be installed from this GitHub with the "devtools"" package and the following:
